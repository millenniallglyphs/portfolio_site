                  I was hired to create an ultra-modern, upscale skincare brand called Hälsa. The client wanted something contemporary, that remained in touch with its Scandinavian roots. Taking inspiration from the landscapes of Sweden, the organic palette contrasts the minimal, geometric logo. I was responsible for custom logo type and the creation of brand guidelines.

  During my time at Bitclaims, I was responsible for initial product research, interaction, strategy, design, development, and hand-off.

            <h3>Epiphyte</h3>
              <p>
                Epiphyte is a prototype for a new kind of economy, that uses living sensors to account for the externalities of industry. Employing lichen and moss to develop air quality metrics, epiphyte makes trades on the stock market that correspond to environmental health. Epiphyte is the culmination of a year long humanistic studies research project, combined with a six month design capstone. Project deliverables include the prototyped body of the tradebot, a code repository, an explanatory video, a website, and a 40 page research paper. This spring, I was invited to present this research at RadicalxChange, in Detroit.

Employing lichen and moss to develop air quality metrics, epiphyte makes trades on the stock market that correspond to environmental health. Epiphyte is the culmination of a year long humanistic studies research project, combined with a six month design capstone. Project deliverables include the prototyped body of the tradebot, a code repository, an explanatory video, a website, and a 40 page research paper. This spring, I was invited to present this research at RadicalxChange, in Detroit.

              <p>
                Responding to the recent UN climate report giving us 12 years to develop systems of resiliency in the face of catastrophic climate change, I prototyped ways of accounting for the remaining time. These experiments focus on rapid itteration within a variety of mediums, resulting in the creations of a chrome extension, a tabletop clock, a ceremonial candle and website.

              <p>
                Unsaid, a symposium highlighting original research in the arts and humanities, hired me to develop both branding and exhibition design for the senior show. With research often being overlooked, I decide to create a brand that made it take center stage. Using day glow orange, I took inspiration from constructions signs, creating a brand that couldn't be ignored. Responsible for posters, invitations, and exhibition design, I created a small zine as a bonus!

                I was honored to have been invited to the Fall 2018 IDEO CoLab makeathon in Cambridge Massachusetts.
My teammates and I prototyped an ATM used for dispersing micro-loans to unbanked communities. It was an intense, but incredibly rewarding day!
